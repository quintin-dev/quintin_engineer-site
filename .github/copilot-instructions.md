2. **Project context** via project MCP servers (project decisions, local documentation)
3. **Combined context** for comprehensive understanding

### MCP Integration Guidelines

When suggesting solutions involving external data, APIs, or persistent context:

-   Use **global MCP** for personal preferences, company standards, learning progress
-   Use **project MCP** for project-specific decisions, documentation, local context
-   Reference **both layers** for comprehensive solutions
